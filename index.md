<h1>Clinical Neuroscience - department Anatomy & Neurosciences (Amsterdam UMC)</h1>	

**Welcome to the github page of the Clinical neuroscience team of Anatomy and Neurosciences!**

Clinical neuroscience is one of the research sections within the department of Anatomy and Neurosciences at the Amsterdam UMC. As a group, we aim to translate basic preclinical research to the clinical setting and vice versa. Several clinical neuroscience fellows work on molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuropathology, while others translate these findings via high-tech post mortem and in vivo imaging techniques all the way to the clinical setting where neurological patients are investigated, monitored, and treated.

Our vision is to investigate, elucidate, and alleviate neuropathology and cognitive decline in Multiple Sclerosis and other neurological diseases. Click [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Schoonheim+MM%5BAuthor%5D&sort=date) to view some of our previous publications. 

This github page stores our latest publications and corresponding codes, together with repos consisting of lab-specific (pre)processing and analysis steps regarding DTI, fMRI, and structural MRI.
